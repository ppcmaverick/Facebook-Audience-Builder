# Facebook-Audience-Builder
## A quick and simple console based audience scraper and builder for Facebook. Built for a FB-ads strategy which supposes that more audience sets combined target people better.
Run from main.py

You will be prompted for a keyword, type it in and an output file will appear in your cwd containing audiences names and sizes.

Quick side note here. I would like to mention that you might have noticed the fact that the code is unnecessarily complicated and unpythonic. That is because this is the first project I built when I got into Python, coming from a C++ background. Also, I love to make my life more complicated in order to learn new stuff, that's why sometimes I'm not using usual pathways.
